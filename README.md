My bibtex style files


####  jprsty.bst 
my version of the physical reviews style file  but it knows about eprints and puts in titles 


#### msiformat.bst
For MSI format CV, same as jprsty.bst, but only does etal for >10 authors 

#### apsrev4-1_stephane.bst
A version Stephan Coen (I think) hacked to embolden specific author names.
